	<h2>Name</h2>

	<h2>Nickname</h2>
	<p>Jaeser/JM</p>

	<h2>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</h2>
	<p>CMSC 123</p>
	<p>Although it was not an easy subject, it really challenged me to think innovatively on how to implement a certain problem. It was very rewarding to get the answer after hours of trying to solve it.</p>

	<h2>Favorite programming language so far and why</h2>
	<p>Python</p>
	<p>As overrated as it is, it is true that Python is one of the most convenient PL to code with. I am usually a forgetful person, so I always had to relearn a PL (e.g. HTML) for a class. Python makes that process faster and more efficient.</p>

	<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
